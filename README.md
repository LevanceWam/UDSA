<h1 id=home>Ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms Course</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms Tutorial!</p>

<p>This is part 1 of a series. In this part we are going to talk about linear data structures such as arrays, linked list, stacks, queues and hash tables. This is awesome for people who didn't get the concept or preparing for a job interview.</p>

<p>Big companies will ask you these questions to see if you can think like a programmer. In this course the materials in this series will change how we think about coding. It will teach us gow to think like a programmer and design fast and scalable algorithm in this series the code will be written in Java so it will be our job to convert this to Javascript or Python. </p>

<p>In this course we are going to solve a lot of problem like a lot of problems. This is going to help us learn the art of problem solving. All of the questions here are popular interview questions. </p>
