<h1 id=home>Ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms Course</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms Tutorial!</p>

<p>This is part 1 of a series. In this part we are going to talk about linear data structures such as arrays, linked list, stacks, queues and hash tables. This is awesome for people who didn't get the concept or preparing for a job interview.</p>

<p>Big companies will ask you these questions to see if you can think like a programmer. In this course the materials in this series will change how we think about coding. It will teach us gow to think like a programmer and design fast and scalable algorithm in this series the code will be written in Java so it will be our job to convert this to Javascript or Python. </p>

<p>In this course we are going to solve a lot of problem like a lot of problems. This is going to help us learn the art of problem solving. All of the questions here are popular interview questions. </p>

<h2 id=section1>The Big O Notation</h2>

<h3>What is Big O</h3>

<p>The Big O Notation is a mathimatical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.</p>

<p>The Big O Notation is used to describe the performance of an algorithm and this helps is determine of a given algorithm is scalable or not. Which basically means is an algorithm going to scale well as the input grows really large. Just because the code executes quickly on our computer doesn't mean it's going to perform well when you give it a large data set. Big companies are always asking about Big O, they want to know if we really understand how scalable an algorithm really is.</p>

<h3>Growth Rates</h3>

<p>These growth rates are used to define our algoritm's run time complexity. Depending on the notation it tells us about the behavior of our function. These are a few of the different kind of growth rates out there.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Constant O(1)</li>
    <li>Logarithimc O(log n)</li>
    <li>Linear O(n)</li>
    <li>Quadratic O(n^2)</li>
    <li>Exponential O(2^n)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=section2>Arrays</h2>

<p>Arrays are data structures that are built into most programming languages and we use them to store a list of items sequentially. We are going to look at the various strengths and weakness of arrays. We are going to see how to use them and build a array class from scratch. </p>

<h2 id=section3>Linked List</h2>

<h3>What are Linked Lists</h3>

<p>We use linked list to keep a list of objects in sequence. But unlike arrays linked lists grow and shrink automatically. A linked list consist of a group of nodes in sequence. Each node holds 2 pieces of data one is a value and the other is the address of the next node in the list. So each node points or references the next node. This is why we refer to these structures as linked list because the nodes are linked together.</p>

<p>The First node is called a head and the last one is called a tail.</p>
