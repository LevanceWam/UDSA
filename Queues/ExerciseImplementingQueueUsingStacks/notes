Another popular interview question is implementing a queue using 
a stack 

now the trick part about this is that stacks follow LIFO so even though 
the order the items go in the stack are correct the item that is popped or removed from the 
stack is not so we have to find a way to remove the items from the stack in the right order

Solution:

This exercise was a little tricky but we managed to come through and solve the problem
So starting off it was really simple 
we created our enqueue method which was really easy and it is important to note that this is a O(1) 
operation because we are just adding to the stack which is fast

now on to the tricky part as we mentioned above stacks are LIFO so this 
is the complete opposite of a queue that is FIFO
we need to find a way to pop or remove the first item in the queue instead of the last

Well one work around this is to create 2 stacks the second stack will
