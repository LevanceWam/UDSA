This is the notes for PriortyQueues

This is a special kind of queue in PriortyQueues objects are processed 
based on their priorty not the order that they entered the queue.

so think of this example lets say that we have a bunch of mail
we aren't going to open it at the moment but we are going to 
put the most important ones at he top regradless of what order they came in.
so the mail is now ordered by the priorty we set them 

In javascript and python we do not have this built in class we have to
implement our own version.

now the explain that we were shown there were items that were pushed 
into the queue but when we removed them they came out a different way than we had them this
is because the priorty of the queue

for example
we pushed 5 3 2 1 in that order into the queue
when we go to remove or pop them they come out like this 
1 2 3 5
This is because by default the smallest numbers come out first.
