This is the notes for ExerciseBuildingAQueueUsingArrays

for this exercise we need to make a queue using a array 
here are the methods we need to have inside of it:
enqueue
dequeue
peek
isEmpty

Solution:
This was very simple doing this task 
I will make one note that is a bit of a slip up
when doing the dequeue we need to use the shift method
this method removes the first element in a array and lowers the index for the other elements
everything else in the file is self explanatory
