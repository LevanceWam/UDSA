This is the notes for QueuesInJava

In java Queues are a interface not a class it can not be instantiated or new up.
interfaces do not have code like classes so we can not instantiate them
But this is the case for java and the already have this built in 
we do however need to look into interfaces and know what they are:

An interface is a syntactical contract that an entity should conform to. In other words, an interface defines the syntax that any entity must adhere to. 
Interfaces define properties, methods, and events, which are the members of the interface. Interfaces contain only the declaration of the members.

JS and Python on the other hand do not have this luxuary. We have to build this 
from scratch so for the first attempt we are going to build a queue using a linkedList
and later on in the section we are going to build it with a array so all we need to do 
is build it with some simple methods
like enqueue adding to the back
dequeue remove from the front 
peek
isEmpty
There is a isFull method but this applies more to the java because we can set a limit to arrays there 
in JS and Python our arrays,list are dynamic so it would defeat the purpose 
but we will come up with some logic that way if we are asked about it then we can answer the question.
