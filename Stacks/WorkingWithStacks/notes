This is the notes for WorkingWithStacks

We are going to take a look at the stack class that we are going to be 
building 


We should be able to store any type in a stack

We should be able to push things into the stack

then there is the pop method that removes and return the last item on the stack
so we should be able to store the stack in a varible after running this method and it 
return the value that was removed 

Then when we print the stack the item removed is not there

There is also peek which returns the item on the stack with out removing it 
we should also be able to store this into a variable and when we print it 
it will return the item on the top of the stack

side not in java they have a search method buit this is not common because 
stacks are not meant for storing a list of objects and looking them up quickly 


we are now going to look at a common interview question concerning stacks in the next lecture.
