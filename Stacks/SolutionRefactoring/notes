This is the notes for SolutionFirstRefactoring

so for this exercise we need to refactor the code 
we did a great chunk of it when we put the values inside of an array and
used the indexof the elements to help us but we had a big if block that needed a 
face lift

solution:
Now tackling the 4 lines of if statements
this statement checks to see if the closing matches the opening 

now I had an idea to compare the value of the arrays against eachother 
but what I was trying to do was grab the element by the index and compare the value
there was 2 things wrong with this :

1. I had no way of getting numbers into the algorithm to target the index like I wanted
without using magic numbers and adding a for loop making it bulky

2. Even if i did find a way to increment the numbers and get the value from the index
the values don't match so it wouldn't have worked

So the option that worked the best that I shrugged off was comparing the 
opening and closing expressions by the index
I had everything in the list matching already I should've compared from the index a long time ago
