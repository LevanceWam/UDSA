This is the notes for SolutionSupportingOtherBrackets

We are extending from the previous exercise
we are going to work on supporting the other opening and closing expression

solution:

for my solution I created a array to hold all of the right brackets and all of the left brackets 

Then inside of the for Of loop I replace the algorithm that was previously there and changed it like This

for the first if statement that handled pushing to the stack 
we are now looking to see if the character of the string is in the array by using indexOf
with indexOf this finds the index of the character if it is in the array and if it doesn't we get a -1
so we wrote the if statement if the indexOf ch doesn't equal -1 then push the character into the stack

for the next if statement just make some minor changes to it from the previous lecture 
now after the pop we want to check and see if the  opening and closing brackets match 
so we wrote a series of if statements to make this work

in the next lecture we are going to refactor the code.
