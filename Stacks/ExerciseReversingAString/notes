for this exercise we need to take a sring and reverse it 
using a stack this is a common interview question concerning stack
An explaination of the method will be provide below

*Quick Note: I did not understand that for this project we were supposed to 
build a brand new function using the stack class to solve the 
exercise I went ahead and created a method that does what the exercise is 
requiring of me which is not bad just wasn't very clear what we needed to do for the 
exercise

It should also be noted that these exercise were done in java
I am coding in javascript and python. Java has a stack class already
built into the language I have not found anything that says we have one.

So mine is built from scratch and will be emproved on in the future
Also I will be building a stack using a linked list and array

Solution 1:

For my attempt I created the reverse string method in the object prototype
or as a class method in python 

so what I thought would be easy to do is use the printstack method We made to return the 
items in the stack as a string
It is very important to stress that our implementation of printstack is our own version 

With this string I took it and split it into an array using the split method 
Because the split method takes an string and seperates its characters in to a 
array.

Then I took that said array and applied the reverse method. this takes all of the elements in the 
array reverses the order. with this our string was reversed but it is still in a array

This is where we take it to the next step and use the join method to 
join all of elements in the array into a string

We would then return the string
now we can store the result in a variable and print the result.

Solution 2:
This is the attempt made after realizing that we needed to make a seperate function outside of 
the stack class and create a new stack object inside of a new function to 
create the reverse string 

A small hiccup but we managed to go above and beyond 

So for this we need to create a couple of things
the function
the stack object
counter
empty string 

so the first thing we needed to do was create a function and 
create a parameter for the user to pass the string too.

now that this is done we create a new stack object
a variable called count and set it to 0
and a variable called str and set it to a empty string

the count variable is going to keep track of how many items we have in the stack
normally this would be a job for the size property that we have but we want to 
complete this exercise as if we didn't implement size or we don't know it  

The empty string will be used to catch the reverse input given to the function

Now the first task is figuring out how to get the string input 
into the stack character by character 

so for this I used a for Of loop to iterate through each character in the string
inside of the for of block I stack.push(ch) so I pushed each character one by one into the stack
and after each character is pushed we iterate the count variable by 1

Now that the string has been pushed into the stack 
we need to figure out how to reverse it 

well one of the methods that we have in the stack is called pop this returns the 
last item in the stack

So we are going to plan to pop the items and append or concat the item to the str variable!

But how are we going to traverse through the stack and better yet in one try

we use for loop
we create a standard for loop and we set the number it stops at to the count we made earlier
this way we don't  use the pop method too much or little and 
inside of this block we are going to decrement the count 

we return the string and print it to the console.
