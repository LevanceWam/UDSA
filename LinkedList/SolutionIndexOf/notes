Now we are going to work on creating the indexOf method

This method should return to us the index of a item in the linked list 
but this isn't an array so we have to make the functionality our selves

First thing we want to do is delcare the function and pass a parameter
this parameter is going to be the item we search for in the list 

next we are going to want to keep track of all the items in the list so 
we created a variable called index so we can do that task

we are going to set up a variable called current to keep track of which
node we are in so we are going to set it to the first node in the list 

now we are going to write a while statement
this states that if current is not null then it will run this statement 
until we find the node we are looking for or until it is null 

inside of the while statement we are going to write a if statement 
if the current value and the item we are searching for equal each other 
return the index

now that we are outside of the index we are going to write the logic to 
increment the index 
so if the item we are searching for is not in current node we are going to 
set the node to the next value and increment the index

this process will continue until we find the node we are looking for or until it reaches the end
if we hit the end and did not find the index we will return a 1 if the node doesn't exist
