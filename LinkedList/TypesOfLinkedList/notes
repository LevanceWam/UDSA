This is the notes for TypesOfLinkedList

we have 2 kinds of linked list singly and doubly

singly list are everything we have worked with so far 
every node has a reference or a pointer to the next node

in doubly every node also has a reference to the previous node
 what is the benefit to this 
 well remember when we had to delete an item from the end of the list 
 and we had to travese it to find the previous node before the last this is a O(n) operation
 well doubly list solves this problem because it already references the previous node this makes
 it a O(1)

now there is a cost with a doubly. this cost is that doubly takes more space than a singly linked 
list but this can be negligible for performance gain when we are removing an item at the end 

Now both singly and doubly list will be circular which means the last node will reference 
the first node so we get a circle 

Now what would be the benefit from this 
we can user these list when we need a circle 
for example imaginge we want to build a music player
we give it a playslist and it plays each song in the list 
after it reaches the last song it starts over this is a circle
