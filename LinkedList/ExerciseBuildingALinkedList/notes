We are going to build a linked list from scratch this lecture 

to start we are going to need 2 classes one being the class called node
this will have a value field and a node field called next so with the node field we can keep a 
reference to the next node 

we are going to need a linkedList class with these 2 field 
first or head 
last or tail

the methods we need to make for this class are 
addFirst 
addLast
deleteFirst 
deleteLast
contains
indexOf

These are the essential methods that we need in a linked list
this is important because later on in other sections we are going to have to make stacks and queques and we are
going to implement them using linked list so linked list is one of those essential
fundamental data stuctures that we need to master
