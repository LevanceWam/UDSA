There are several cheatsheets on the internet that gives us the runtime 
complexity of various operations 

we want to stay away from these because this is not going to help us when it comes
time for a interview 

when it comes to data structures memorization doesn't work we 
have to understand the concepts of what we are doing how they work 
how they store values and how to perform various operations on them and 
whay is the runtime complexity on them

so if we don't understand something or we need a little bit more time to 
brush up we need to review everything and try it again with out help

if we don't understand how they work we will never be able to answer the interview questions
