Now we are going to add the addFirst method 
to the linked list class

we are going to add a new node to the beginning of the list
this is going go be very similar to the add last method we did earlier 

So first create the function and parameter to be passed 
then we are going to check to see if the head is empty

so if the head equals null the we are going to set the new node to the 
head and tail (first and last)

else
we are going to set the new node next property to the previous head and 
set the head to the new node
