this is the notes for ConvertingLinkedListToArrays

we are going to create a method that converts the list into a array
this method is expecting a regular array we can not pass a linked list 
through the array

we set variables for the array, current and index

We are going to want to traverse throw the list so we are going to need a while statement 
this while state will say as long as current is not null then we are going to add the 
current value at a certain index
we increment the index so different values have different indexes then
set current to current.next for the next iteration of the while loop


now in python we have a rule with our arrays/list that if the index doesn't have a 
value we can not set it 
to make it simpler since our array is empty we can not target the index and set a value
there already has to be a value or we will get the IndexError: list assignment index out of range

but in javascript we do not have this issue 

at the end of the loop we can print or return the array
