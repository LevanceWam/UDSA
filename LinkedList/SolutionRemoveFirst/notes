We are going to create the removeFirst method

This method should be able to go to the top of the list and 
remove the first node and its next should be the new 
first node.

so first we want to write a if statement if the 
list is empty

if the first node is null then we are going to throw a error and notify the user 
that the list is empty

Then we are going to wan to write another statement for if there is only one node
the method is really good for multiple nodes
but if we find only one node we will get a error because this is also the last item in the 
list
So we are going to check if the first node is the last node and if they are 
set them to null and return not allowing the rest of the function to run

now to write the logic for removing the first node 
so as it stands we just don't want to delete the node becasue it will destory our link
this is bad want we want to do is reference the link and have it continue 

so first we need to store the the node that comes after the first in a variable 
so we would call first.next
then we are going to want to set the first node to null
wiping it out and then we are going to want to set the first node to the variable
were we stored the node that was after the first one
