First we are going to work on the add last method
this method should add a new node to the last node

we start by making the method outside of the constructor
then we are going to want to delare the function and pass a value
this value is what will be placed at the end of the list 

now inside of the function we want to declare a variable with a new node object called newNode

after that we are going to want to check to see if there is anything 
on the head of the linked list

 if it is empty/null we will pass the node object as the 
head of the list and the last node 

else 
if the head is not empty/null and there is items in the list then we will 
set the last node to newNode
and set last to the newNode as well this way it will know it is at the end
