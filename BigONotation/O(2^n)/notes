This is the notes for O(2^n)

the last growth rate we are going to talk about is exponential growth O(2^n)
which is the opposite of logarithmic growth O(log n)

the logarithmic curve slows down as the input size grows 
but exponential curve grows faster and faster 
obviously a algorithm runs in exponential time is not scalabe at all
it will become real slow real soon
we will see an example in code later in the future 

all we need to understand is that exponential growth is the opposite of logarithmic growth
also heads up there are more growth rates we haven't talked about but 
the ones we talked about is the one we see most of the time 

so we need to try and remember these ones
