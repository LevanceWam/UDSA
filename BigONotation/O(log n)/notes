This is the notes for O(log n)

another growth rate we are going to talk about us the 
logaritmic growth which we are going to show with
O(log n)
(we have a screen shot we can refer too )

now looking at the logaritmic curve compared to the linear curve
the linear one grows at a constant rate but the logaritmic curve
slows down at some point
so a algorithm that runs in logaritmic time is more 
effcient and more scalable than a algorithm than runs in linear or poor value time 

here is an example 
we have a array of sorted numbers 1 - 10 and we want to find the number 10
one way to find it is to iterate with a for loop until we find the 10
this is called a linear search because it runs in linear time 

worse case scenario if the number we need is at the end we have
to inspect every item and the more we have the longer it takes
so the runtime of this algorithm increases linearly and in direct proportion
with the size of the array

now we have another searching algorithm called binary search and this algorithm runs in  
logaritmic time this is much faster than the linear search
assuming that our array is sorted we start off by looking at the middle item
it looks to see if this item is smaller or greater than the value we are looking for 
in this case because its 10 it is smaller so the target number must be in the right '
part of the array so we don't need to look on the left side of the array 

with this we can narrow done the search by half
then it repeats it again, is it smaller or greater than the target value
it ignores the items on the left and focuses on the right 
so witht this algorithm we are narrowing down the search by half


so if we had a million items in the array this would take 19 comparsions to complete
this allows us not to check every element in the array this is logaritmic time in action
we have logaritmic growth ib algorithm where we reduce the work by half in every step
we are going to see this alot in the 2 part where we talk about trees and graphs 

for now the take away is that an algorithm with logaritmic time is more scalable then 
one with linear time
