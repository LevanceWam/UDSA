this is the notes for Space Complexity

now that we know that we can use Big O notation to describe the runtime Complexity
of our algoritms in a ideal world we want our algorithms to be super fast and scalable 
and take minimum amount of memory but unfortunately that hardly happens 

most of the time we have to do a trade off between saving time or saving Space

so we need a way to talk about how much space a algorithm requires
and this is where we use the big O notation again lets look at a few examples

first we have a greet method that takes a array of strings and prints a message
with all of the names in the array
