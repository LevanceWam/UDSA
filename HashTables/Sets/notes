This is the notes for Sets

In many of the programming languages we have a data structure that is similar
to hash maps or hash tables but are slightly different 
Hash map/tables map a key to a value 

we have another data structure called a set and they 
only have keys not values 
these are very useful for solving problems just like the 
hashes Sets do not allow duplicate keys 

so if we have a list of numbers if we have any duplicates and we want 
ton get rid of them if we add them to a set it will get rid of the duplicates

sets have the same methods just like a hash table 
add
remove
removeAll
contains
containsAll
size
clear

NOTE*
We have sets in JS!!
