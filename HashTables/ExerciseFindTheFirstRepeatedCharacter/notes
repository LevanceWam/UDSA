This is the notes for ExerciseFindTheFirstRepeatedCharacter

Another popular interview question is another variation of the 
exercise we had earlier 
so for this one we want to find the first repeated character

solution:
This is exercise is a little easier than the alternative

so what we have to do is to check and see if
the set has the character already 

if it does we return the character of the string immediately
if it does not we add the character to the array
