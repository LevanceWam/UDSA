This is the notes for HashFunctions

going forward we are going to see how these data structures work 
interally and why they are super fast

earlier in the section we said that when we insert a key value pair in a hash table
this hash table will get the key and based on this we'll figure out where to
store this value in memory 

but technically we store this value in an array so in more accurate terms the hash table 
should map this key to a index value
the index at whichbwe should store this value this is the job of a hash 
function 

a hash function is a function that get a value and maps it to a different kind of 
value which we call a hash value a hash code digest

now to the context of data structures a hash function maps a key 
value to an index value.
