This is the notes for OpenAddressingQuadraticProbing

as we saw from the previous video clusters can form
when we use the linear probing algorithm these clusters reduce performance

to solve this issue we can use quadratic probing
so the formula for linear probing was hash(key)+1
quadratic probing is hash(key)+i^2

how does this solve our problem exactly?

well with linear probing we are incrementing i by 1 in each step
so new key value pairs are stored next to each other 
and form a cluster

but if we use the quadratic formula our key value pairs get spread out more widely

just to clearify this is a simplified version of 
the formula for quadratic probing (hash(key)+1^2)
here we ahve to set the % operater because this can get bigger than the boundary 
of the array so we should always reduce it to the size of the array

so the quadratic probing solves the clustering problem 
but there is another problem that comes with this because we are doing big jumps  
to get to a empty slot we end up back at the beginning of the array and we keep 
iterating over the same steps this can lead to a infinite loop with linear probing we do not have this problem
