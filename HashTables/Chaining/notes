This is the notes for Chaining

in the next few videos we are going to be looking at 
some ways to deal with collisons

The first way we are going to look at chaining 
this invovles using a linked list to store multiple items 
at the same array index

Ex:
let's say the size of our array is 5 so we have 5 cells or spots to 
put values in. these cells are known as buckets or slots 
intially all of our buckets are null or empty 

now lets try inserting a key value pair of 6 and A 
we pass the key to our hash function and the function will
return the reminder of the list which will end up being index 1 in the array

but it will not be directly in the cell instead it is going to be wrapped by a linked list node 
and we are going to have the cell point to the linked list

now if we use key value pair 8 and B it will go to index 3 wrapped in a linked list node
next we have 11 and C now this will go to index 1 and store its value at the end of the linked list 

this is the idea of chaining we are chaining a bunch of items together this is where the name comes from 
with this approach we will no longer have collisons and the linked list will shrink and expand automatically
