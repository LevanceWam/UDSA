This is the notes for ExerciseFindTheFirstNonRepeatedCharacter

This is a popular interview question. it is finding the first non repeated 
character in a string.

So if we have a string like A Green Apple
so we should write a method that will return g as the first non repeated character in the string
we are going to work with lowercase words instead of trying to worry about captials and such.

solution:

first we are we are going to have to iterate through the string and 
count each time a character is repeated 
we are going to use a hash table to solve this 

now to iterate through all of the characters in the string we 
are going to need a for Of loop
this will iterate through the character of the string indiviually

With this till will allow us to push each character into the hash table

now the main job of this loop is to see if in each iteration if we 
have the character and if we do we increment it by 1 otherwise we insert it into the
hashtable 

so if map.containskey(ch) we need to read the value of the key
by using map.get(ch) and store it in a variable called count 
then we update it by calling the put method
else if we dont have the character we need to set it to one

Now this was a little repetitive so we decided to use a ternary to shorten it 
I am going to write out the full if statement here for me to understand and 
see the difference

for (let ch of string){
    if(map.containsKey(ch)){
        let count = map.get(ch);
        map.put(ch, count);
    } else {
        map.put(ch,1)
    }
}
for some reason this iteration of the loop makes 'a' return?

to make the ternary these are the steps taken 
we created the variable count 
this is where we will type the boolean expression
 (map.containsKey(ch) ? map.get(ch)) so if we have the character we are going to
 set its value if we don't we will set it to zero

 now that we have the count we are going to use map.put(ch, count +1) to increment the value 

now if we look at the map keys we are going to see that the characters did not enter the 
hashtable the way we entered them 

so we need to create another for loop that iterates the string characters again
now we write a if statement if we get the character value from the hash table and it equals 1
we return that and thats how we get the first non repeated character from a string;
