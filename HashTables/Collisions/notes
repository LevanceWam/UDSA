This is the notes for Collisions

When we are generating hash values it is possible 
that two distinct keys generate the same hash value 

now lets say that our hash function generates the hash value of 10
for storing 2 different values 
We can not store 2 items at the same index this is what we call a Collision
we have 2 values that are colliding 

there are 2 ways to handle collisions

One Way:
one way is to have each cell in the array point to a linked list 
so we are not going to store the values in the array itself
we are going to store them in the linked list if we have a collision 
then we simply add the new item to the end of the link list
this is what we call chaining  because we are chaining the items 

Second Way:
The other solution is to find a different slot for storing the second value this is 
what we call open addressing because we're finding a new address to store the second value 
there are different open addressing algorithms
